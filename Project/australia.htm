                <h3>Sydney Opera House</h3>
                <p>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.[3][4]

                    Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973[5] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.</p>

                <h3>Yarra Valley</h3>
                <p>The Yarra Valley is the region surrounding the Yarra River in Victoria, Australia. The river originates approximately 240 km (150 mi) east of the Melbourne central business district and flows towards it and out into Port Phillip Bay. The name Yarra Valley is used in reference to the upper regions surrounding the Yarra River and generally does not encompass the lower regions including the city and suburban areas, where the topography flattens out, or the upper reaches which are in inaccessible bushland. Included in the Yarra Valley is the sub-region of the Upper Yarra Valley which encompasses the towns of the former Shire of Upper Yarra in the catchment area upstream of and including Woori Yallock. The Yarra Valley is a popular day-trip and tourist area, featuring a range of natural features and agricultural produce, as well as the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail.</p>

                <h3>Cable Beach</h3>
                <p>Cable Beach was briefly mentioned before but it deserves a spot in this list by itself. Sprawling over a vast 22 km, Cable Beach is a stunning piece of dazzling turquoise sea and white sand. The beach was named after the communication cable lines which were laid from Java to Broome in the year 1889. Now you can enjoy the sun in here and rest easy on just the beautiful patch of golden sand. Here’s an important tip- from the months of November till May, the dangerous for humans, Irukandji jellyfish are found in the waters. So it’s best to avoid these months. Moreover, keep in mind that the beach burns in the heat as the sun climbs so sunscreen and an umbrella is a must.

                    Things to do: Enjoy camel rides, enjoy a day on the beach, have some local food at the nearby cafes and restaurants.</p>
